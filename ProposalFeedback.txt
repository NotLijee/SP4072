Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Tradie
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Not done.  DANG!

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
   Nice work here.  Your presentation is a nice, subdued template that's easy
   on the eyes.  You spoke well, knew what you were going to say, talked to
   the audience instead of the slides, and answered questions well.  You had
   a very knowledgeable and professional demeanor as well, but included some
   humorous touches which made the presentation very engaging and easy to pay
   attention to.  Excellent graphics, as well.  VERY well done, Elija!

Summary:
--------
Total:  3% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  Great start to the semester, but get that proposal document
into your repository ASAP so the percentage comes back up!
