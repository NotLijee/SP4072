Comments:
---------
Nice work!

On problem 1.1, you have "plan" instead of "requirements", but I think that
   is close enough to warrant the full amount, especially since you have it
   listed in problem 1.2!

On problem 4.2, you have it all right except the critical path should start
   with task G.  32 days is the correct duration, so I'm assuming you just
   didn't realize you needed to specify the "G" task at the start.

On problem 4.4, your Gantt chart starts on Monday instead of Wednesday, and
   you don't show any breaks for weekends or the specified holidays.  There
   should be some gaps in the bars!

On problem 5.3, you were supposed to apply the categories to the different
   items listed.  It should be:
      B, U&F, U&F, U&F, N, N, N, N, N, F, F, U&F, U&F, U&F, U&F, U&F

All in all, not a bad job on this assignment.
