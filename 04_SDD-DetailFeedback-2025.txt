   Excellent job on this section ~ nothing to add here, although it would be
   helpful to have a short explanation for each of the items in the lists.

DETAILED CLASS DESCRIPTIONS:
   More detail needed for this section.  See above comment.

For detailed design, you should be specifying all of the parts of all of the
sections/subsystems of your software.  Your diagrams are the same ones from
the previous submission so there's no new detail in them.  Also, your detail
sections don't really add much to the design descriptions you had already.

For example, the architecture might give a list of classes and a sentence on
what each one is for.  The detailed design would specify the list of classes
with each one listing its fields and what they represent, along with methods
in the classes and what they are responsible for.  There would be a matching
diagram that shows the classes and their associations, including subclassing
if applicable, and there would be text along with the diagrams to explain
things like what types of fields are in any data structures that are passed
as messages between classes or objects.  Database descriptions will have an
ERD that shows the tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and also has data on
protections and user roles allowed.

THAT'S what goes into a 'detailed' design document.
