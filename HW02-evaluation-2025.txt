Comments:
---------

problem 5-2, very good analysis!  I like to see you are thinking, Elijah!  I
   hadn't actually thought about using a small database to store the set of
   best moves ~ great idea!

problem 5-4, while your answer is true, the question wasn't asking about the
   user interface, it asked what the best *ARCHITECTURE* would be.

Otherwise, excellent job on this assignment ~ keep it up!
